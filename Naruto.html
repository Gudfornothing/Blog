      Anime is a style of animation that originated in Japan and has gained
      global popularity. It covers a wide range of genres, including action,
      adventure, romance, fantasy, horror, and slice-of-life. Anime is known for
      its distinct art style, vibrant characters, imaginative worlds, and
      complex storytelling. While anime is typically produced as TV series or
      films, there are also web series and OVA (Original Video Animation)
      formats. Popular series like Naruto, Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia,
      and One Piece showcase anime's ability to blend action-packed battles with
      emotional character development. Meanwhile, films by Studio Ghibli, such
      as Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro, highlight the genre's capability
      for deep, heartfelt stories and stunning visuals. Anime often adapts manga
      (Japanese comics) or light novels, though many are original works. Beyond
      entertainment, anime reflects various themes, including friendship,
      perseverance, identity, and societal issues, making it a versatile and
      influential medium. It has grown into a massive global phenomenon,
      influencing pop culture, fashion, and even art across the world. Fans
      appreciate anime for its creativity, emotional depth, and the unique way
      it addresses both light-hearted and serious topics.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h3>
      Naruto is a Japanese anime and manga series created by Masashi Kishimoto.
      It follows the journey of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja from the Hidden
      Leaf Village, who dreams of becoming the strongest ninja and earning the
      title of Hokage, the village's leader. Naruto was born with a powerful
      entity called the Nine-Tails Fox sealed inside him, which had once
      attacked the village. Because of this, Naruto was ostracized by the
      villagers. Despite his loneliness, he remains determined, cheerful, and
      eager to prove his worth.
    </h3>
    <h2>Naruto</h2>
    <h3>
      Naruto: This covers Naruto’s early days as a ninja, his training, and his
      adventures with his teammates, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, under the
      mentorship of Kakashi Hatake. Naruto forms deep bonds with them,
      particularly with Sasuke, who becomes like a rival and brother. However,
      Sasuke eventually leaves the village to gain more power from a villain
      named Orochimaru.
    </h3>
    <h2>Naruto Shippuden</h2>
    <h3>
      Naruto: Shippuden: This part picks up after a time skip, with Naruto
      returning to the village after training with Jiraiya, a legendary ninja.
      Naruto faces more powerful enemies, including the criminal organization
      Akatsuki, which is hunting the Tailed Beasts (including the Nine-Tails in
      Naruto). Much of this arc revolves around Naruto's efforts to bring Sasuke
      back to the village and his growth into a more powerful ninja. He learns
      the truth about many hidden secrets, including his parentage and the
      deeper history of the ninja world. Ultimately, Naruto fights to achieve
      peace, culminating in a massive battle during the Fourth Great Ninja War,
      where he and his allies face the resurrection of ancient enemies. The
      series concludes with Naruto achieving his goal of becoming Hokage and
      establishing peace in the ninja world.
