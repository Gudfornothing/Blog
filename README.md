 Anime is a style of animation that originated in Japan and has gained
      global popularity. It covers a wide range of genres, including action,
      adventure, romance, fantasy, horror, and slice-of-life. Anime is known for
      its distinct art style, vibrant characters, imaginative worlds, and
      complex storytelling. While anime is typically produced as TV series or
      films, there are also web series and OVA (Original Video Animation)
      formats. Popular series like Naruto, Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia,
      and One Piece showcase anime's ability to blend action-packed battles with
      emotional character development. Meanwhile, films by Studio Ghibli, such
      as Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro, highlight the genre's capability
      for deep, heartfelt stories and stunning visuals. Anime often adapts manga
      (Japanese comics) or light novels, though many are original works. Beyond
      entertainment, anime reflects various themes, including friendship,
      perseverance, identity, and societal issues, making it a versatile and
      influential medium. It has grown into a massive global phenomenon,
      influencing pop culture, fashion, and even art across the world. Fans
      appreciate anime for its creativity, emotional depth, and the unique way
      it addresses both light-hearted and serious topics.
